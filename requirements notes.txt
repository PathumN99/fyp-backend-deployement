In Python Flask, you can use the pip package manager to install packages and their dependencies.
To install packages listed in a requirements.txt file, you can use the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This command will install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file and their dependencies.
You can create a requirements.txt file in your Flask project by running the following command:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

This command will generate a requirements.txt file that contains a list of all the packages installed
in your virtual environment, along with their versions. This file can then be used to install
the same packages and their dependencies on another machine or environment.
